<h3>
    About K.I.S.S.
</h3>
<p> K.I.S.S is a co-educational boarding school for Grades 9 to 12. Prospective students are drawn to our schoolâ€™s innovative approach, university preparatory programmes, and spectacular views.<br><br>

Since 1923, we have worked diligently to establish a transformative place of learning and leadership, mirroring the educational experience of a small college rather than a traditional boarding school. Our primary purpose is to help students gain the independence and skills necessary to succeed in the post-secondary world while studying in a safe, caring, and nurturing environment.<br><br>

Today, K.I.S.S stands as a model of progressive, West Coast boarding. Our school is a remarkable place to make lifelong friends while gaining a world-class education. We welcome visitors and invite you to share in the K.I.S.S experience.</p>
